## Hosting Options

### On Premise Hosting

On-premise solutions are software that is installed and run on individuals computers or the organization using the software. You download it, install on your choice of server and complete the initial setup. With this comes the individual responsibility for the website infrastructure and its software dependencies like databases, necessary software libraries, and more. On-premise CMS can be run locally on your own computer for free, or, if you want to be able to access it from outside of this environment, you can install it on a server with a hosting service for a small monthly fee.

### benefits of investing in an on-premise CMS?

There are several reasons why using on-premise CMS is better than going with cloud-hosted solutions. They include the following:

*  You have full control over data. It makes your business GDPR-compliant.
*  You host the website. Thus, you are in complete control of the website customization and have more freedom in its management.
*  It can efficiently work without any updates and plugins, if you donâ€™t want to install them.
*  Ability to extend the backend API services and the Admin Panel GUI with your own custom features.
