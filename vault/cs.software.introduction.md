## Software development goals

* Higher quality
* Large program systems
* With many participants
* Under cost and time constraints

## Development costs and time

* no production costs! $\Rightarrow$ costs = time expenditure
* Initial development vs. further development:
  * Approx. 60% of the total costs for maintenance!
* App: Few days or weeks
* business software: weeks to years

## Top problems of software developing

* Incomplete or hidden requirements
* Communication flaws between the project team and customer
* Underspecified requirements
* Communication flaws within the project team
* Time boxing
  
  | succeeded | transgressions | canceled |

## Core issues of software development

* **Quality**: How do we ensure that the software system does what it should?
* **Stakeholders 1**: How do we achieve that the software product is useful for the users?
* **Stakeholders 2**: How do we achieve that the software system to develop efficiently and in particular understandable for new developers and to be further developed in the long term?
* **Cost/Time**: How do we make sure that Software system with the specified resources (money, technology, people) completed on time and on budget?

Diagrams:
A diagram is a symbolic representation of information using visualization techniques. Diagrams have been used since prehistoric times on walls of caves, but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-dimensional surface. The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.
