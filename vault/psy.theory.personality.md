## Introduction

* There are more connections in your brain than there are atomic particles in the universe
* Personality is a hybrid discipline: part time science, part time engineering (clinical)

### Definition of Personality

* personality can change
* personality predicts ideology
  * orderliness predicts political conservatism
  * creativeness predicts liberalism
* we don't know anything about how to improve intelligence
* you act in a way that what you want to happen will happen
  * you learn from mistakes: you don't get what you want. But even worse: You made a mistake in conceptualizing the world.

## Clinical practice

* find out what people are afraid of and avoiding (past/present/future) break it down into smaller pieces, help them find strategies of approach and mastery -> improves quality of their personality
