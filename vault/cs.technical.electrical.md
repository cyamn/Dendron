## Charge

* Charge is a property of ã…¤elementary particles
  * electrons, protons, pions, muons,
  * there is positive and negative charge
  * charge occurs only in discrete units
  * some particles don't have charge (neutrons, photons,...)
* The unit for charge is ã…¤the coulomb $C$
* The unit load is ã…¤$e=1.602176634\cdot 10^{-19}C$
* One coulomb requires about $6.25\cdot 10^{18}$ electrons
* Analogy for charge is ã…¤amount of water (litres, kg)

---

## Current

* Current (symbol usually $I$) is ã…¤the flow of charge $Q$, i.e charge per time: $I=Q/T$ or, more precisely, $I=dQ/dt$
* The unit for current is ã…¤ampere $A$
* At $1 A$, $1$ coulomb flows through a wire per second
* Analogy for current is water flow (litres/second)

## Voltage

* Voltage is ã…¤the difference in electrical potentials
  * i.e. the energy required to move a unit charge in an electric field
* the unit for voltage is ã…¤volt $V$
* Analogy for voltage is water level / pressure (Pa)

## Ground

* Ground is a ã…¤reference potential to which we relate all voltages
* A synonym for ground is ã…¤mass
* switch symbols are: ã…¤![](/assets/images/2022-02-06-20-55-45.png)

## Kirchhoff's laws

* node rule: ã…¤The sum of all currents in a node is zero
  ![](/assets/images/2022-02-06-21-02-31.png)
  Follows from conservation of charge (charge cannot vanish).

--

* loop rule: ã…¤The sum of the voltages in a closed loop is zero
  ![](/assets/images/2022-02-06-21-04-47.png)
  Follows from conservation of energy

---

## Power

* In order to maintain a current flow, energy must be constantly expended.
* The required power is ã…¤$P=U\cdot I$
* The unit for power is ã…¤$W$ watt

---

## Energy

* The (electric) energy is ã…¤$E=P\cdot T$ (power over time)
* The unit for energy is ã…¤$J$ joule
* A full car 'battery' (accumulator) contains e.g. an energy of $50 kWh = 50 kW \cdot 1h = 50,000 W \cdot 3,600 s = 180 MJ$

---

## Resistors
* A resistor is ã…¤a component with 2 terminals that a current can flow through if a voltage is applied
* The unit for resistance is ã…¤$\Omega$ omega
* If the current is proportional to the voltage, we call it ohmic resistor that holds:
  * $I=U\cdot G$, $\;G$ is the master value in Siemens $[S]$
  * $I=U/R$, $\;R$ is the resistance in ohm $[\Omega]$
  * $G, R$ describe the same behavior. $G = 1/R, R = 1/G$

* Parallel connection of resistors

* Series connection of resistors

## Voltage Divider

$$
\begin{circuitikz} \draw
(0,0) to[battery] (0,4)
  to[ammeter] (4,4) -- (4,0)
  to[lamp] (0,0);
\end{circuitikz}
$$

## Capacitors / Capacitance

* A capacitor can ã…¤store charge (Q).
* The unit for capacity is ã…¤$C$ farad
* The capacity is ã…¤$C=Q/U$
* Analogy for capacitor is bathtub holding water level
* Charge capacitor
  * without resistor: $U(t) = \frac{I_0}{C}\cdot t$
  * with resistor $U(t) = U_0 - U_0 e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}$
